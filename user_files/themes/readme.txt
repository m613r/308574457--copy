To create your own customized themes
make a copy of Anki.json from ./themes to ./user_files/themes,
name and edit it according to your wishes.

User edited themes should be placed in the ./user_files/themes
folder.

This addon is also compatible with the themes of ReColor,
which means that the uploaded community themes can also
be downloaded and used:
- https://github.com/AnKingMed/AnkiRecolor/wiki/Themes

Place the downloaded themes in the ./user_files/themes folder 
as well.
